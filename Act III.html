            Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies<br>

            In motion of no less celerity<br>

            Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen<br>

            The well-appointed king at Hampton pier<br>

            Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet<br>

            With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:<br>

            Play with your fancies, and in them behold<br>

            Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;<br>

            Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give<br>

            To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,<br>

            Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,<br>

            Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,<br>

            Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think<br>

            You stand upon the ravage and behold<br>

            A city on the inconstant billows dancing;<br>

            For so appears this fleet majestical,<br>

            Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:<br>

            Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,<br>

            And leave your England, as dead midnight still,<br>

            Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,<br>

            Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;<br>

            For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd<br>

            With one appearing hair, that will not follow<br>

            These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?<br>

            Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;<br>

            Behold the ordnance on their carriages,<br>

            With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.<br>

            Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;<br>

            Tells Harry that the king doth offer him<br>

            Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,<br>

            Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.<br>

            The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner<br>

            With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,<br>

            <p><i>Alarum, and chambers go off</i></p>

            And down goes all before them. Still be kind,<br>

            And eke out our performance with your mind.<br>

            As young as I am, I have observed these three<br>

            three, though they would serve me, could not be man<br>

            to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to<br>

            a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and<br>

            red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but<br>

            fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue<br>

            and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks<br>

            words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath<br>

            heard that men of few words are the best men; and<br>

            therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'<br>

            should be thought a coward: but his few bad words<br>

            are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never<br>

            broke any man's head but his own, and that was<br>

            against a post when he was drunk. They will steal<br>

            any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a<br>

            lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for<br>

            three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn<br>

            brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a<br>

            fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the<br>

            men would carry coals. They would have me as<br>

            familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their<br>

            handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,<br>

            if I should take from another's pocket to put into<br>

            mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I<br>

            must leave them, and seek some better service:<br>

            their villany goes against my weak stomach, and<br>

            therefore I must cast it up.<br>

            Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil<br>

            As send precepts to the leviathan<br>

            To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,<br>

            Take pity of your town and of your people,<br>

            Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;<br>

            Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace<br>

            O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds<br>

            Of heady murder, spoil and villany.<br>

            If not, why, in a moment look to see<br>

            The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand<br>

            Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;<br>

            Your fathers taken by the silver beards,<br>

            And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,<br>

            Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,<br>

            Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused<br>

            Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry<br>

            At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.<br>

            What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,<br>

            Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?<br>

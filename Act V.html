            Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,<br>

            That I may prompt them: and of such as have,<br>

            I humbly pray them to admit the excuse<br>

            Of time, of numbers and due course of things,<br>

            Which cannot in their huge and proper life<br>

            Be here presented. Now we bear the king<br>

            Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,<br>

            Heave him away upon your winged thoughts<br>

            Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach<br>

            Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,<br>

            Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,<br>

            Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king<br>

            Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,<br>

            And solemnly see him set on to London.<br>

            So swift a pace hath thought that even now<br>

            You may imagine him upon Blackheath;<br>

            Where that his lords desire him to have borne<br>

            His bruised helmet and his bended sword<br>

            Before him through the city: he forbids it,<br>

            Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;<br>

            Giving full trophy, signal and ostent<br>

            Quite from himself to God. But now behold,<br>

            In the quick forge and working-house of thought,<br>

            How London doth pour out her citizens!<br>

            The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,<br>

            Like to the senators of the antique Rome,<br>

            With the plebeians swarming at their heels,<br>

            Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:<br>

            As, by a lower but loving likelihood,<br>

            Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br>

            As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br>

            Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,<br>

            How many would the peaceful city quit,<br>

            To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,<br>

            Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;<br>

            As yet the lamentation of the French<br>

            Invites the King of England's stay at home;<br>

            The emperor's coming in behalf of France,<br>

            To order peace between them; and omit<br>

            All the occurrences, whatever chanced,<br>

            Till Harry's back-return again to France:<br>

            There must we bring him; and myself have play'd<br>

            The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.<br>

            Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,<br>

            After your thoughts, straight back again to France.<br>

            Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for<br>

            your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I<br>

            have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I<br>

            have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable<br>

            measure in strength. If I could win a lady at<br>

            leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my<br>

            armour on my back, under the correction of bragging<br>

            be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.<br>

            Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse<br>

            for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and<br>

            sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,<br>

            Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my<br>

            eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;<br>

            only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,<br>

            nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a<br>

            fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth<br>

            sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love<br>

            of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy<br>

            cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst<br>

            love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee<br>

            that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the<br>

            Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou<br>

            livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and<br>

            uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee<br>

            right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other<br>

            places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that<br>

            can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do<br>

            always reason themselves out again. What! a<br>

            speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A<br>

            good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a<br>

            black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow<br>

            bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax<br>

            hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the<br>

            moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it<br>

            shines bright and never changes, but keeps his<br>

            course truly. If thou would have such a one, take<br>

            me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,<br>

            take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?<br>

            speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.<br>

            O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend<br>

            The brightest heaven of invention,<br>

            A kingdom for a stage, princes to act<br>

            And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!<br>

            Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,<br>

            Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,<br>

            Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire<br>

            Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,<br>

            The flat unraised spirits that have dared<br>

            On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth<br>

            So great an object: can this cockpit hold<br>

            The vasty fields of France? or may we cram<br>

            Within this wooden O the very casques<br>

            That did affright the air at Agincourt?<br>

            O, pardon! since a crooked figure may<br>

            Attest in little place a million;<br>

            And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,<br>

            On your imaginary forces work.<br>

            Suppose within the girdle of these walls<br>

            Are now confined two mighty monarchies,<br>

            Whose high upreared and abutting fronts<br>

            The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:<br>

            Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;<br>

            Into a thousand parts divide on man,<br>

            And make imaginary puissance;<br>

            Think when we talk of horses, that you see them<br>

            Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;<br>

            For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,<br>

            Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,<br>

            Turning the accomplishment of many years<br>

            Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,<br>

            Admit me Chorus to this history;<br>

            To this imperial throne. There is no bar<br>

            To make against your highness' claim to France<br>

            'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'<br>

            Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze<br>

            To be the realm of France, and Pharamond<br>

            The founder of this law and female bar.<br>

            Yet their own authors faithfully affirm<br>

            That the land Salique is in Germany,<br>

            Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;<br>

            Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,<br>

            There left behind and settled certain French;<br>

            Who, holding in disdain the German women<br>

            For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>

            Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female<br>

            Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,<br>

            Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.<br>

            Then doth it well appear that Salique law<br>

            Nor did the French possess the Salique land<br>

            Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great<br>

            Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>

            Beyond the river Sala, in the year<br>

            Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,<br>

            King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,<br>

            Did, as heir general, being descended<br>

            Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,<br>

            Make claim and title to the crown of France.<br>

            Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown<br>

            Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male<br>

            Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,<br>

            To find his title with some shows of truth,<br>

            'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,<br>

            Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,<br>

            Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son<br>

            To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son<br>

            Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,<br>

            Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,<br>

            Could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br>

            Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied<br>

            That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br>

            Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,<br>

            Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:<br>

            By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great<br>

            Was re-united to the crown of France.<br>

            So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.<br>

            King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,<br>

            King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear<br>

            To hold in right and title of the female:<br>

            So do the kings of France unto this day;<br>

            Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law<br>

            To bar your highness claiming from the female,<br>

            And rather choose to hide them in a net<br>

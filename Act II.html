        <b>Chorus</b>

        <blockquote>

            Now all the youth of England are on fire,<br>

            And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:<br>

            Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought<br>

            Reigns solely in the breast of every man:<br>

            They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,<br>

            Following the mirror of all Christian kings,<br>

            With winged heels, as English Mercuries.<br>

            For now sits Expectation in the air,<br>

            And hides a sword from hilts unto the point<br>

            With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,<br>

            Promised to Harry and his followers.<br>

            The French, advised by good intelligence<br>

            Of this most dreadful preparation,<br>

            Shake in their fear and with pale policy<br>

            Seek to divert the English purposes.<br>

            O England! model to thy inward greatness,<br>

            Like little body with a mighty heart,<br>

            What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,<br>

            Were all thy children kind and natural!<br>

            But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out<br>

            A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills<br>

            With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,<br>

            One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,<br>

            Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,<br>

            Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,<br>

            Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!<br>

            Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;<br>

            And by their hands this grace of kings must die,<br>

            If hell and treason hold their promises,<br>

            Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.<br>

            Linger your patience on; and we'll digest<br>

            The abuse of distance; force a play:<br>

            The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;<br>

            The king is set from London; and the scene<br>

            Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;<br>

            There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:<br>

            And thence to France shall we convey you safe,<br>

            And bring you back, charming the narrow seas<br>

            To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,<br>

            We'll not offend one stomach with our play.<br>

            But, till the king come forth, and not till then,<br>

            Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.<br>

            O peace, Prince Dauphin!<br>

            You are too much mistaken in this king:<br>

            Question your grace the late ambassadors,<br>

            With what great state he heard their embassy,<br>

            How well supplied with noble counsellors,<br>

            How modest in exception, and withal<br>

            How terrible in constant resolution,<br>

            And you shall find his vanities forespent<br>

            Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,<br>

            Covering discretion with a coat of folly;<br>

            As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots<br>

            That shall first spring and be most delicate.<br>

            In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh<br>

            The enemy more mighty than he seems:<br>

            So the proportions of defence are fill'd;<br>

        <blockquote>

            Now entertain conjecture of a time<br>

            When creeping murmur and the poring dark<br>

            Fills the wide vessel of the universe.<br>

            From camp to camp through the foul womb of night<br>

            The hum of either army stilly sounds,<br>

            That the fixed sentinels almost receive<br>

            The secret whispers of each other's watch:<br>

            Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames<br>

            Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;<br>

            Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs<br>

            Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents<br>

            The armourers, accomplishing the knights,<br>

            With busy hammers closing rivets up,<br>

            Give dreadful note of preparation:<br>

            The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,<br>

            And the third hour of drowsy morning name.<br>

            Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,<br>

            The confident and over-lusty French<br>

            Do the low-rated English play at dice;<br>

            And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night<br>

            Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp<br>

            So tediously away. The poor condemned English,<br>

            Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires<br>

            Sit patiently and inly ruminate<br>

            The morning's danger, and their gesture sad<br>

            Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats<br>

            Presenteth them unto the gazing moon<br>

            So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold<br>

            The royal captain of this ruin'd band<br>

            Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,<br>

            Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'<br>

            For forth he goes and visits all his host.<br>

            Bids them good morrow with a modest smile<br>

            And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.<br>

            Upon his royal face there is no note<br>

            How dread an army hath enrounded him;<br>

            Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour<br>

            Unto the weary and all-watched night,<br>

            But freshly looks and over-bears attaint<br>

            With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;<br>

            That every wretch, pining and pale before,<br>

            Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:<br>

            A largess universal like the sun<br>

            His liberal eye doth give to every one,<br>

            Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,<br>

            Behold, as may unworthiness define,<br>

            A little touch of Harry in the night.<br>

            And so our scene must to the battle fly;<br>

            Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace<br>

            With four or five most vile and ragged foils,<br>

            Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,<br>

            The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,<br>

            argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it<br>

            will be a black matter for the king that led them to<br>

            many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the<br>

            business of the master the author of the servant's<br>

            damnation: but this is not so: the king is not<br>

            bound to answer the particular endings of his<br>

            soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of<br>

            his servant; for they purpose not their death, when<br>

            they purpose their services. Besides, there is no<br>

            king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to<br>

            the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all<br>

            unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them<br>

            the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;<br>

            some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of<br>

            perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that<br>

            have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with<br>

            pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have<br>

            defeated the law and outrun native punishment,<br>

            though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to<br>

            fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;<br>

            so that here men are punished for before-breach of<br>

            the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where<br>

            they feared the death, they have borne life away;<br>

            and where they would be safe, they perish: then if<br>

            they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of<br>

            their damnation than he was before guilty of those<br>

            impieties for the which they are now visited. Every<br>

            subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's<br>

            soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in<br>

            the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every<br>

            mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death<br>

            is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was<br>

            blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:<br>

            and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think<br>

            that, making God so free an offer, He let him<br>

            outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach<br>

            others how they should prepare.<br>
